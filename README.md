# Practice Problems

We want you to be as successful as possible in the program.  One way to optimize your opportunities for success is to continuously practice your fundamentals.

This repo is available for you to practice problems from sources outside of Hack Reactor -- both those your mentor finds and those you find -- so that you can track your progress and share it with your Cohort Support Team.

Use of this repo is optional unless it is prescribed to you by your Technical Mentor or another member of your support team.  In that instance, they will provide you with guidance about how they would like you to use it.

## Mentor Contributions

From time-to-time your Technical Mentor or HiR will add problems to this repo for you to challenge yourself with.  Pull from this repo often to make sure you have the latest catalog of problems.

## Your contributions

You are encouraged to find interesting problems in books, on the Internet, from friends and other repos in GitHub and add them to your fork of this repo.  You will be submitting all pull requests to your branch of this repo as you work.
